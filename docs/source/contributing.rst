Contribution opportunities
==========================

We welcome and appreciate contributions from the community, researchers, and practitioners alike to enhance the functionality, usability, and documentation of our package.
For instructions on how to set up a development environment, see :ref:`development`.
Here are some key areas where your contributions can add significant value:

Methodological enhancements
----------------------------

Custom evaluation classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are eager to provide more evaluation classes for problem variants into our package.
Contributions that introduce custom evaluation classes, especially those that cater to niche or emerging areas in routing problems, are highly valuable.

Operators and algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The performance of most metaheuristic algorithms is heavily reliant on the strength of the local search component, which again relies on innovative operators and algorithms.
By contributing novel or improved operators and algorithms, you aid in enhancing the packageâ€™s efficiency and accuracy.

Documentation improvements
-----------------------------

Improving conciseness and clarity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While we strive to provide comprehensive documentation, there is always room for enhancement.
Contributions that focus on making the documentation more concise and clear are essential.
Your insights and revisions can make the content more accessible and user-friendly, aiding users to grasp concepts and utilize the package effectively.

Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Practical examples play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world application.
Contributions that add well-documented and diverse examples enrich the learning experience for users, offering them tangible insights into how the package can be applied to solve actual routing problems.
